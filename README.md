This is a set of project files to make it possible to use OpenFrameworks with Android Studio.

# OBSOLETE

Android Studio support has been merged into openFrameworks officially as of 0.9.0. Therefore, this repository is *obsolete* and is kept around for code history and informational uses only.

Please follow the instructions at http://openframeworks.cc/setup/android-studio/ to set up openFrameworks with Android Studio. Those directions have been tested with Android Studio 1.5.1 and NDK r10e (newest versions as of January 11, 2016).
